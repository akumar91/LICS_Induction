Variables: 
	// Variables for lights in directions
	// lns: light in north-south direction
	// lsn: light in south-north direction
	// lew: light in east-west direction
	lns, lsn, lew

	// Variables for sensors in directions
	sns, ssn, sew

Initial state:
	sns_0 & ssn_0 & sew_0

Constraints:
	// Lights cannot be conflict
	!(lns & lew)
	!(lsn & lew)

Transitions:

	// If the light is on at previous 2 steps, 
	// it must become off this step
	// These constraints corresponds to the maximal 2 seconds of each light
	// The minimum 1 second is implicit.
	!(lns_{k-1} & lns_k) | !lns_{k+1}  
	!(lsn_{k-1} & lsn_k) | !lsn_{k+1}  
	!(lew_{k-1} & lew_k) | !lew_{k+1}    

	// If light is on, and the sensor is true at previous step, it must become false at this step
	!(lns_{k+1} & sns_k) | !sns_{k+1}
	!(lsn_{k+1} & sns_k) | !ssn_{k+1}
	!(lew_{k+1} & sns_k) | !sew_{k+1}

	// If the light is off at this step, and the sensor is True at previous step
	// the sensor should not be changed
	!(!lns_{k+1} & sns_k) | sns_{k+1}
	!(!lsn_{k+1} & ssn_k) | ssn_{k+1}
	!(!lew_{k+1} & sew_k) | sew_{k+1}


Final state:
	// Stop when collision happens
	(lns_n & lew_n) | (lsn_n & lew_n)
